# Gemini CLI System Rules: Clean Code Engine

## 1. Core Engineering Principles
* **SOLID Compliance:** Enforce SRP, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.
* **Anti-Smell Detection:** Eliminate Long Methods, God Objects, Duplicated Code, and Shotgun Surgery.
* **KISS & YAGNI:** Prioritize the simplest solution; no over-engineering or speculative features.

## 2. Architecture & Design
* **Clean Architecture:** Maintain strict separation between Domain, Use Cases, and Infrastructure layers.
* **Design Patterns:** Use Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns only where they reduce complexity.
* **Naming Conventions:** * **Variables/Functions:** camelCase; descriptive, intention-revealing names.
    * **Classes/Interfaces:** PascalCase; nouns for classes, adjectives/nouns for interfaces.
    * **Booleans:** Prefix with `is`, `has`, or `can`.

## 3. Optimized Prompt Injection
> **Instruction:** When generating or refactoring code, always apply the following condensed rule-set to ensure high-quality output:

**Ruleset:** `SOLID, DRY, KISS, no-code-smells, clean-arch, descriptive-naming, simple-logic, decoupling, 0-redundancy, maintainable-structure`
